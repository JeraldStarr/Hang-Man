# Hangman
This is a game in which the user's task is to guess the password. The password is hidden and the letters are replaced by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. The guesser chooses the letter from the keybord and if the password contains this letter, it is displayed on the screen in proper place. The guesser can win by guessing all the letters that appears in the password. If the password does not contains the chosen letter, the guesser is penalized by adding an element to the diagram - the element of the gallows. If the guesser makes enough incorrect attempts the complete picture hangman is displaying in the screen.
