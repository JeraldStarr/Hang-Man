# Hangman
This is a game in which the user's task is to guess the password. The password to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. The guesser chooses the letter from the keybord and if the password contains this letter, it is displayed on the screen in proper place. The guesser can win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the password. If the password does not contains the chosen letter, the guesser is penalized by adding an element to the diagram. If the guesser makes enough incorrect guesses to allow to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser is losing.
